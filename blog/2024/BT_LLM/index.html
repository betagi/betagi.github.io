To this end, we have constructed a localized knowledge base for an open-source large language model using exclusive information from Chongqing University’s <a href="https://eie.cqu.edu.cn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Elite Institute of Engineering</a> (EIE).

Introduction</h1> <h2 id="11-motivation">1.1 Motivation</h2> <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in generating complex and coherent text. At its core, a language model calculates the probability distribution of the upcoming sequences of words in a given context <d-cite key="Martin2024"></d-cite>. However, the opaque internal mechanisms of language models often function as “black boxes”, which poses challenges on formally understanding for their decision-making processes. The foundational theory and in-depth exploration of the mathematical frameworks for understanding how neural networks work is still lacking.</p> <p>Furthermore, to enhance the reasoning capabilities and accuracy of LLMs, we propose constructing a localized knowledge base. This innovation addresses the challenge of integrating domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, facilitating more accurate and contextually relevant responses. By developing such knowledge bases, we aim to create LLM-based digital avatars capable of engaging in meaningful interactions and responding to specific queries with greater precision.</p> <p>This thesis aims to enhance the interpretability of LLMs by elucidating their intrinsic workings. Inspired by GPT-2’s architecture and recent theoretical frameworks <d-cite key="Simon23"></d-cite>, our analysis seeks to clarify how LLMs process and generate language. By exploring mechanistic interpretability and establishing localized knowledge bases, we enhance LLMs’ reliability and efficiency through access to domain-specific knowledge, which provides a clearer understanding of their internal operations and access to domain-specific knowledge for executing specific tasks.</p> <h2 id="12-thesis-structure">1.2 Thesis Structure</h2> <p>This thesis focuses on enhancing the transparency and effectiveness of LLMs by exploring mechanistic interpretability and integrating them with localized knowledge bases.

Background</h1> <p>The evolution of language models unfolds chronologically from the initial statistical language models (SLMs) to subsequent neural language models (NLMs), progressing to pre-trained language models (PLMs), and eventually to the current state of LLMs</p> <p>The progression of language modeling evolve from statistical methods to neural network-based approaches, and subsequently to the transformer architecture and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs). This evolution of language model that we present here, has been driven by the need to capture the nuanced semantic meaning of language more effectively, thereby improving the performance of language modeling tasks. In this chapter, we present a new perspective on the developments of LLMs, contrasting with the traditionally chronological and exhaustively detailed view of LLMs <d-cite key="Naveed24"></d-cite>.</p> <p>In this chapter, we will delve into the relentless pursuit of capturing nuanced semantic meaning via various kinds of language modeling methods, ranging from traditional $n$-gram models to the state-of-the-art architectures like GPT and Mamba. As each innovation builds upon the strengths of its predecessors while addressing their limitations, we can expect further advancements in language modeling to bring us closer to achieving human-level language understanding.</p> <h2 id="21-early-statistical-models">2.1 Early Statistical Models</h2> <p>Statistical Language Models (SLMs), which emerged prominently in the 1990s, are based on statistical learning methods that predict the likelihood of sequences in text. These models fundamentally rely on the Markov assumption, which assumes that the prediction of a word depends only on its predecessors, leading to the development of $n$-gram models (bigrams and trigrams are the most prevalent choices).</p> <p>In order to construct the probability distribution $P(w_1 w_2 \dots w_n)$ for a word sequence $w_1,w_2,…, w_n$, which calculates the likelihood of the given word sequence appearing as a sentence $ \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n w_i$, for example<d-footnote>Notice that Equation \eqref{eq:1} illustrates a potential output from SLMs. Although the characters in this example are nonsensical, they underscore a critical limitation: SLMs do not inherently understand the essence of language, which could lead to the generation of such implausible linguistic sequences. This phenomenon highlights the models' comprehension on statistical correlations rather than semantic meanings, suggesting the potential for generating nonsensical yet syntactically plausible text under certain conditions.</d-footnote>:</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ P(\text{thae besst gibberish }_{gen}\text{era}^{tor}) = P(\text{thae}) \cdot P(\text{besst | thae }) \cdot \\ P(\text{gibberish | thae besst }) \cdot P(_{gen}\text{era}^{tor}\text{ | thae besst gibberish})} \label{eq:1} \end{equation}\] <p>Here we define $\mathbb{W}$ as the vocabulary of all words and $|\mathbb{W}|$ as the size of the vocabulary, $n$ is the number of words. Then, considering that sentence generation generally proceeds from left to right, the calculating process can be modeled as follows:</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ P\left(w_{1} w_{2} \ldots w_{n}\right)=P\left(w_{1}\right) P\left(w_{2} \mid w_{1}\right) P\left(w_{3} \mid w_{1} w_{2}\right) \cdot P\left(w_{n} \mid w_{1} w_{2} \ldots w_{n-1}\right) \\ =\prod_{i=1}^{n} P\left(w_{i} \mid w_{1} w_{2} w_{3} \ldots w_{n-1}\right)} \label{eq:2.2} \end{equation}\] <p>For conciseness, Let \(\{ w_i \} _{i=1}^{n-1}\) denotes the sequence \(w_1,w_2,\ldots, w_{n-1}\), then</p> \[\begin{equation*} P\left(w_{1} w_{2} \ldots w_{n}\right)= \prod_{i=1}^{n} P\left(w_{i} \mid\left\{w_{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{n-1}\right) \end{equation*}\] <p>The simplest approach to estimating \(\prod\limits_{i=1}^{n} P\left(w_{i} \mid\left\{w_{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{n-1}\right)\) based on a given corpora is to infer from the frequency of word sequences appearing in the corpora. Let $C(w_j)$ represent the count of a word sequence occurring in the corpora. By applying the principle of maximum likelihood estimation, when the sample size of words is sufficiently large, one can approximate the conditional probability between words using their relative frequencies, then:</p> \[\begin{equation} \prod_{i=1}^{n} P\left(w_{i} \mid\left\{w_{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{n-1}\right)=\frac{C\left(w_{1} w_{2} w_{3} \ldots w_{i-1} w_{i}\right)}{C\left(w_{1} w_{2} w_{3} \ldots w_{i-1}\right)} \label{eq:2.3} \end{equation}\] <p>To address issues of data sparsity inherent in high-order $n$-grams, various smoothing techniques were introduced, like <em>backoff estimation</em> and <em>Good–Turing estimation</em>. Backoff estimation allows for a graceful degradation of $n$-gram order when data is insufficient, while Good–Turing estimation adjusts the probability distribution to better account for unseen events in a dataset.</p> <p>SLMs have been critical in advancing the performance of various NLP tasks, and they are especially adept at handling relatively small corpora. However, they were constrained by the <em>curse of dimensionality</em>, as the number of possible word sequences increases exponentially with the length of the context window<d-cite key="Bengio00"></d-cite> . This exponential growth posed significant challenges in estimating probabilities for less common word sequences, leading to severe data sparsity issues and an exponential increase in possible combinations, demanding high memory and computational resources.</p> <p>Moreover, SLMs faced limitations in handling the complexity and variability of human languages<d-cite key="Martin2024"></d-cite>. Despite efforts to enhance their performance through innovations like smoothing techniques and the integration of more sophisticated probabilistic models, the inherent limitations of a purely statistical viewpoint restrict models to grasp the intricate structure of language.</p> <h2 id="22-paradigm-shift-to-neural-network-models">2.2 Paradigm Shift to Neural Network Models</h2> <p>The transition from Statistical Language Models (SLMs) to Neural Language Models (NLMs) marked a significant paradigm shift in natural language processing. While SLMs generate word sequences using probability distributions, NLMs leverage the power of neural networks to capture complex language representations.</p> <p>The pioneering work<d-cite key="Bengio00"></d-cite> introduced the concept of <em>word embeddings</em> within the framework of neural networks. By representing words as dense vectors in a continuous space, the model proposed by previous research <d-cite key="Bengio00"></d-cite> outperformed pure $n$-gram models. The word embedding matrix $\mathbf{E}$ enables the model to capture semantic and syntactic relationships between words.</p> <p><strong>Multilayer Percpetrons (MLP)</strong>. MLPs are feed-forward neural networks consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. In the context of language modeling, MLPs take a fixed-size context window of words as input and predict the next word in the sequence.</p> <p>For an MLP with $L$ hidden layers, the activation of the $l$-th layer, $\mathbf{h}^{(l)}$ can be expressed as:</p> \[\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{h}^{(l)}=\sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}^{(l)} \boldsymbol{h}^{(l-1)}+\boldsymbol{b}^{(l)}\right) \label{eq:2.4} \end{equation}\] <p>where $\mathbf{W}^{(l)}$ and $\mathbf{b}^{(l)}$ are the weight matrix and bias vector of the $l$-th layer, respectively, and $\sigma(\cdot)$ is a non-linear activation function, such as $\tanh$ or sigmoid. MLPs are trained using the back-propagation algorithm which is based on gradient descent optimization of a loss function:</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathcal{L}(\Theta)=-\log P(y \mid \boldsymbol{x} ; \Theta) \end{equation}\] <p>where $\Theta$ represents all the learnable parameters of the MLP. MLPs have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies due to the fixed-size context window and lack of explicit memory mechanisms, but they laid the foundation for more advanced neural network architectures, such as RNN.</p> <p><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</strong>. RNNs are a class of neural networks designed to process sequential data. Unlike MLPs, RNNs maintain a hidden state that serves as a memory, allowing them to capture long-term dependencies in language. RNNs addressed the sequential nature of language by maintaining a hidden state \(\mathbf{h}_{t}\) that depends on the current input \(\mathbf{x}_{t}\) and the previous hidden state \(\mathbf{h}_{t-1}\):</p> \[\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{h}_{t}=\sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{h h} \boldsymbol{h}_{t-1}+\boldsymbol{W}_{x h} \boldsymbol{x}_{t}+\boldsymbol{b}_{h}\right) \end{equation}\] <p>where \(\boldsymbol{W}_{h h}\), \(\boldsymbol{W}_{x h}\) and \(\boldsymbol{b}_{ h}\) are are all learnable parameters, and $\sigma(·)$ is a non-linear activation function.</p> <p>RNNs have shown remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks because of their recurrent structure, including language modeling, machine translation, sentiment analysis, etc. However, standard RNNs suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which hinders their ability to capture long-range dependencies effectively. To address this issue, variants of RNNs, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)<d-cite key="LSTM97"></d-cite> and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)<d-cite key="GRU14"></d-cite> have been proposed, introducing gating mechanisms to regulate the flow of information over time.</p> <p><strong>Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)</strong>. However, training RNNs for tasks that require long-range information proved challenging due to the vanishing gradient problem. LSTM networks<d-cite key="LSTM97"></d-cite>, an extension of RNNs, addressed this issue by introducing gating mechanisms to control the flow of information:</p> \[\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \boldsymbol{i}_{t}=\sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{x i} \boldsymbol{x}_{t}+\boldsymbol{W}_{h i} \boldsymbol{h}_{t-1}+\boldsymbol{b}_{i}\right) \\ \boldsymbol{f}_{t}=\sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{x f} \boldsymbol{x}_{t}+\boldsymbol{W}_{h f} \boldsymbol{h}_{t-1}+\boldsymbol{b}_{f}\right) \\ \boldsymbol{o}_{t}=\sigma\left(\boldsymbol{W}_{x o} \boldsymbol{x}_{t}+\boldsymbol{W}_{h o} \boldsymbol{h}_{t-1}+\boldsymbol{b}_{o}\right) \\ \boldsymbol{c}_{t}=\boldsymbol{f}_{t} \odot \boldsymbol{c}_{t-1}+\boldsymbol{i}_{t} \odot \tanh \left(\boldsymbol{W}_{x c} \boldsymbol{x}_{t}+\boldsymbol{W}_{h c} \boldsymbol{h}_{t-1}+\boldsymbol{b}_{c}\right) \\ \boldsymbol{h}_{t}=\boldsymbol{o}_{t} \odot \tanh \left(\boldsymbol{c}_{t}\right) \label{eq:2.7} \end{aligned} \end{equation}\] <p>where \(\mathbf{i}_{t}\), \(\mathbf{f}_{t}\) and \(\mathbf{o}_{t}\) are the <em>input</em>, <em>forget</em>, and <em>output gates</em>, respectively, and \(\mathbf{c}_{t}\) is the cell state, and \(\odot(\cdot)\) here denotes element-wise multiplication. LSTMs became the most commonly used extension to RNNs for language modeling tasks.</p> <h2 id="23-emergence-of-the-generative-pre-trained-transformer">2.3 Emergence of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer</h2> <p>The introduction of the transformer architecture by researchers at Google<d-cite key="Vaswani17"></d-cite>revolutionized neural network design for language modeling. The success of transformer architectures paved the way for the development of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), which leverage large-scale corpora and self-supervised learning to acquire intrinsic language knowledge. The key innovation of transformers lies in the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to attend to different positions of the input sequence in parallel. Here we provide a brief introduction to transformer architecture.</p> <p>Given an input sequence \(\boldsymbol{X} = \{\mathbf{x}_{1}, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_{n}\}\), the self-attention mechanism computes <em>query</em>, <em>key</em>, and <em>value</em> matrices \(\boldsymbol{Q}, \mathbf{K}\) and \(\boldsymbol{V}\) by using learned projection matrices \(\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}\), \(\boldsymbol{W}_{K}\) and \(\boldsymbol{W}_{V}\). The attention scores are computed as the scaled dot product between the query and key matrices, followed by a \(\text{softmax}\) function to obtain attention weights:</p> \[\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \boldsymbol{Q}=\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \boldsymbol{W}_{Q} \quad \boldsymbol{K}=\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \boldsymbol{W}_{K} \quad \boldsymbol{V}=\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \boldsymbol{W}_{V} \\ \operatorname{Attention}(\boldsymbol{Q}, \boldsymbol{K}, \boldsymbol{V})=\operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{\boldsymbol{Q} \boldsymbol{K}^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}}\right) \boldsymbol{V} \end{aligned} \end{equation}\] <p>where $d_k$ is the dimension of the key vectors. Multi-head attention extends this mechanism by performing self-attention in parallel across multiple heads, allowing the model to capture different aspects of the input sequence.</p> <p>The <em>Generative Pre-Trained Transformer</em> (GPT) model, introduced by OpenAI <d-cite key="Radford18"></d-cite> around the same time as the BERT <d-cite key="Devlin19"></d-cite>, is primarily composed of a stack of transformer blocks and the prominent example of PLMs. Each transformer block consists of a (masked) multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network, with layer normalization and residual connections linking these components. The blocks are stacked together, with each layer calculating the output of the previous one, and positional encoding procedure is added to the input embedding before entering the transformer blocks.The new language modeling paradigm, closely related to <em>transfer learning</em>, allows the PLMs to gain a general syntactic and semantic understanding of the text corpus and then be trained on task-specific objectives to adapt to various tasks.</p> <p>In summary, the emergence of transformer architectures and the subsequent development of PLMs have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, enabling significant advancements in a wide range of language-related tasks, from machine translation and sentiment analysis to question-answering and text generation, and so forth. By training on vast amounts of unlabeled text data, PLMs learn rich representations of language that can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks.</p> <h2 id="24-the-stage-of-large-language-models">2.4 The Stage of Large Language Models</h2> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BT_LLM/timeline-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/timeline-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/timeline-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/BT_LLM/timeline.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Figure 2.1</strong> This timeline highlights key developments in LLMs frameworks, focusing on those exceeding a specific parameter threshold. It also includes seminal works that, although not LLMs themselves, significantly advanced the field of language modeling. Additionally, the timeline features a selection of smaller language models. Symbols denote specific types of contributions: ♣ indicates entities that function both as models and as methodological approaches, while ◆ denotes purely methodological approaches. This figure is derived from and inspired by the latest research <d-cite key="Minaee24"></d-cite>. </div> <p>Over extensive research spanning decades, language modeling has progressed from initial SLMs to the contemporary landscape of LLMs. LLMs, the large-sized PLMs, show unprecedentedly emergent abilities that go beyond traditional language modeling and start to gain capability to solve more general and complex tasks that was not seen in PLM. The remarkable examples are such as GPT-4 <d-cite key="Brown20,OpenAI23"></d-cite>, T5 <d-cite key="T5"></d-cite>, LlaMa <d-cite key="LlaMa"></d-cite>. The following paragraphs briefly introduce each component. Figure 2.1 illustrates a glimpse at the latest developments in LLMs.</p> <p><strong>Data Processing</strong>. As shown in Chapter 2, the evolution of language models highlights the importance of abundant, heterogeneous and high-scored mixture of data, necessitating the process for data.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>data collection</strong>: As “garbage in, garbage out” suggests, the input data for training or tuning an LLM has a direct impact on the quality of the derived model. The pursuits for data processing <d-cite key="Chen23"></d-cite> are good quality, proper diversity and large amounts. Thus the collection of diverse data, including texts from websites, academic papers, codes, and so on, demands a diverse range of data formats.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>data cleaning</strong>: Cleaning involves identifying and correcting inaccurate and redundant elements within the raw data, such as eliminating duplicated or erroneous data, and reducing noise. Furthermore, some filtering approaches should be applied to minimize the presence of irrelevant or biased information. Moreover, safeguarding privacy is essential; therefore, personal details like names, addresses, and phone numbers should be carefully removed from the dataset before training.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>tokenization</strong>: Analogous to the cognitive mechanisms of the human brain, languages typically simplify complex units into chunks, and in the field of NLP, the chunks are often referred to as tokens through the process known as tokenization. Historically, NLP began with word-level tokenization, using spaces and punctuation to delineate words. The trajectory of semantic representation development has progressed from the Bag-of-Words model to more sophisticated approaches, such as Word2Vec <d-cite key="Mikolov2013"></d-cite> and GloVe <d-cite key="Pennington2014"></d-cite>, all of which aim to capture semantic representations at the word level. Tokenization breaks texts down to smaller units, which can be words, subwords, or symbols. Tokenization helps LLMs to handle out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into subwords, which enhances the model’s adaptability.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Training</strong>. The training process for LLMs consists of two main stages: unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning.</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>unsupervised pre-training</strong>: During pre-training, LLMs are exposed to the large corpora of data, learning the underlying structure of the language without any task-specific instructions. This stage allowed the model to develop the almost all broad knowledge of language, including semantics and pragmatics, as the <em>superficial alignment hypothesis</em> suggests <d-cite key="Liu23"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>instruction tuning</strong>: During instruction tuning, LLMs are trained by instruction-output pairs <d-cite key="Zhang23"></d-cite> to enhance their capabilities, which come from human instructions and desired outputs respectively. The instruction tuning process constricts the outputs from LLMs under the desired responses, allowing human to intervene with the models’ behaviors.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>fine-tuning</strong>: LLMs are refined and aligned with human values during the fine-tuning stage, through specific tasks, such as translation, question-answering, and summarization, which are trained on smaller, task-specific datasets.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Components</strong>. The following paragraphs briefly introduce each component. For in-depth mathematical analysis, please refer to Chapter 5 for detailed descriptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>multi-head masked self-attention mechanism</strong>: This attention mechanism allows a model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence. Unlike previous models such as RNN or LSTM that process words in a sequential manner, self-attention enables the model to look at all parts of the sentence simultaneously. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of context and relationships between words, regardless of their position in the sentence. The masking operation is a critical aspect of this mechanism, especially in the context of language modeling, which ensures that the prediction of a current word does not get influenced by future words.The reason for using the masked version of multi-head attention for the output embeddings is that when we are generating the output text, we do not have the next words yet because the next words are not generated yet <d-cite key="Ghojogh20"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>layer normalization and residual connections</strong>: Each transformer block in GPT includes layer normalization and residual connections. Layer normalization is applied after the self-attention mechanism and after the feed-forward network within each transformer block. It normalizes the inputs across the features, improving the stability of the model. Residual connections allow the input of each sub-layer (i.e., the self-attention and feed-forward networks) to be added to its output.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>position-wise fully connected feed-forward network</strong>: In each transformer block in GPT, after the attention mechanism together with corresponding layer normalization and residual connection, the output is passed through a feed-forward network that applies the same transformation to each position separately and identically.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>positional encoding</strong>: Considering transformers do not inherently process sequential data in order, they use positional encodings to incorporate information about the order of the sequence into their inputs, e.g. RoPE from @Su2021. These positional encodings are added to the input embeddings at the bottom of the model stack, providing the model with information about the position of each word in the sequence.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Limitations</strong>. LLMs encounter a lot of challenges, including hallucinations, outdated or insufficient knowledge, memory issues, highly abstract reasoning tasks, mimicking human-like cognition，and much more <d-cite key="Dong22"></d-cite>. Here we outline some practical limitations of LLMs:</p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Hallucination</strong>: The phenomenon of hallucination occurs when LLMs generate misleading or outright incorrect outputs. These errors often stem from the LLMs’ lack of real-world knowledge, biases in training data, incomplete or false information, over-fitting during training, quantization errors, and the absence of relevant contextual background in prompts, etc. In summary, despite their vast number of parameters, LLMs capture only a small fraction of real-world knowledge and are limited by the temporal scope of their training data. Hallucination raises concerns over the reliability and usefulness of LLMs in real-world applications. For example, when working with patient records and medical data, hallucinations have critical consequences.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Fairness</strong>: LLMs tend to inherit social prejudices from their training data, which significantly impact their fairness in tabular prediction and question-answering tasks, which is hard to mitigate through prompt engineering process. Fairness and bias mitigation techniques encompass pre-processing, in-training, intra-processing, and post-processing interventions <d-cite key="Isabel23"></d-cite>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Political bias</strong>: Understanding the bias within language models is complicated due to the contextual and cultural factors. The LLMs ideology injection experiments <d-cite key="Tang23,Hartmann23"></d-cite> validate that LLM is indeed susceptible to ideologizing, as it exhibited notable emotional deviations particularly on sensitive topics, and that ChatGPT tends to exhibit a preference for left-leaning and pro-environmental viewpoints in its responses to questions.</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>Bias mitigation</strong> <d-cite key="Guo24"></d-cite>. To address these challenges, several strategies can be implemented. Ensuring the use of high-quality data during training, supplementing domain-specific knowledge through <em>fine-tuning</em>, and employing techniques like <em>reinforcement learning from human feedback</em> (RLHF) to bias models towards more accurate data are all viable approaches. Furthermore, guiding LLMs through <em>prompt engineering</em> can also increase both the effectiveness and the controllability of LLMs. Though it is possible to iterate LLMs with new information via solutions as mentioned before, the optimization process (e.g fine-tuning) is resource-intensive, requiring substantial computational resources and time (often on the scale of days or weeks). Hence, retrieval-augmented generation(RAG) <d-cite key="RAG20"></d-cite> framework emerge as a powerful solution to the aforementioned inadequacy of LLMs and other optimization means.</p> <h2 id="25-trends-in-language-modeling">2.5 Trends in Language Modeling</h2> <p>In this part, we explore some significant trends in language modeling, focusing on pre-training, emergent abilities, scaling laws, and the move towards more efficient models. Pre-training enhances LLMs’ adaptability and transfer learning. Emergent abilities like in-context learning and multi-step reasoning enable complex task completion. Scaling laws show how increasing model size, dataset size, and computational resources improve performance. A new trend highlights that smaller, efficient models can achieve high performance, challenging the belief that bigger is always better.</p> <p><strong>Pre-training</strong>. These large-scale models demonstrate unique behaviors in tasks such as zero-shot learning, which were previously challenging for smaller-scale models. The notion of <em>pre-training</em> in this context refers to the process by which these models acquire a general understanding of language from vast corpora.</p> <p>Unlike traditional methods that often start from scratch, pre-training allows models to build upon an expansive, pre-existing linguistic framework. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of the learning process but also enables effective transfer learning. The knowledge acquired during pre-training can be applied to tasks well beyond those it was originally trained on, demonstrating the model’s adaptability and the broad applicability of its learned features.</p> <p>This trend towards larger, more capable LLMs underscores a critical shift in NLP research and development, moving from narrowly focused models to versatile, highly capable systems that can understand and interact in human-like ways across multiple languages and tasks. As we continue to push the boundaries of what these sophisticated models can achieve, the role of pre-training in achieving state-of-the-art results in NLP becomes increasingly prominent, setting the stage for future innovations in the field.</p> <p><strong>Emergent abilities of LLMs</strong>. Recent research has revealed emergent abilities of LLMs, such as improved performance on few-shot prompted tasks <d-cite key="Wei22"></d-cite> , inciting interest in both academia and industry, raising hopes that they could serve as the basics for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Several key emergent abilities of LLMs are critical for data understanding including <em>in-context learning</em>, <em>instruction following</em>, and <em>multi-step reasoning</em> @Fang24. In-context learning refers to designing large auto-regressive language models that generate responses on unseen task without gradient update, only learning through a natural language task description and a few in-context examples provided in the prompt. </p> <p>The GPT-3 model <d-cite key="Brown20"></d-cite> with 175 billion parameters presented an impressive in-context learning ability that was not seen in smaller models. LLMs have also demonstrated the ability to complete new tasks by following only <em>zero-shot prompts</em>, which is purely the instructions of the task descriptions. Solving complex tasks involving multiple steps has been challenging for LLMs. By including intermediate reasoning steps, prompting strategies such as <em>chain-of-thought</em> (CoT) <d-cite key="COT22"></d-cite> have been shown to help unlock the LLM ability to tackle complex arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.</p> <p><strong>Scaling Laws</strong>. Scaling the size of the architectures and the amount of training data has enabled unprecedented capabilities for the resulting LLMs, eliminating the need for fine-tuning on specific tasks. Scaling the size of the architectures and the amount of training data enabled unprecedented emergent capabilities for the resulting LLMs, eliminating the need for fine-tuning for specific tasks. From Kaplan’s insight <d-cite key="Kaplan20"></d-cite>, language modeling performance as a function of model size, dataset size, and amount of compute used for training, leads to the development of scaling laws, as can be seen at Figure 2.2.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BT_LLM/scaling_law-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/scaling_law-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/scaling_law-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/BT_LLM/scaling_law.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Figure 2.2</strong> The performance of language models is influenced by the size of the model, the extent of the dataset, and the computational resources allocated for training <d-cite key="Kaplan20"></d-cite>. </div> <p>Let $P$ denote the model size (number of parameters) and $D$ denote the dataset size (number of tokens in the corpora). According to the empirical formula <d-cite key="Doglas2023"></d-cite>, when one parameter is taken to be very large and the dependence on the other is studied, nontrivial power-law scaling can emerge. Assuming $cal(L)$ represents the test loss, the scaling law can be expressed as:</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathcal{L}(P, D)=\left[\left(\frac{P_{c}}{P}\right)^{\frac{\alpha_{P}}{\alpha_{D}}}+\left(\frac{D_{c}}{D}\right)^{\alpha_{D}}\right] \end{equation}\] <p><strong>Less But More</strong>. While the prevailing pursuit has been the ever-increasing model sizes, which leads to the growth of parameters from millions to billions and now trillions. A compelling counter-narrative is emerging. The new trend aims at reducing model size while maintaining or even enhancing language models’ performances, as exemplified by works such as ChatGLM-6B <d-cite key="GLM22"></d-cite>, Mistral-7B <d-cite key="Mixtra24"></d-cite> and TinyLlaMA-1.1B <d-cite key="Zeng24"></d-cite>. In short, contradicting the belief that “ the larger, the better”, perhaps less is but more.</p> <p>Recent studies <d-cite key="Hoffmann22,Fu24"></d-cite> suggest that we might be overestimating the optimal size of LLMs, and that for a given computational budget, relatively smaller models can achieve superior performance. The implications of this shift are significant, which may reshape the prevailing paradigm in LLMs’ development, and require more research to focus on the more nuanced and efficient model design. However, the optimal models’ scales vary when dealing with the specific tasks and computational constraints, it is still intriguing for future research to explore the novel and diminutive architectures.</p> <h1 id="3-related-works-">3.

In 2017, OpenAI’s discovery of the <em>sentiment neurons</em> <d-cite key="Radford17"></d-cite> marked a significant milestone in this area. These neurons were found to be highly predictive of sentiment values, with their activation responding to specific words and phrases in a obvious manner.</p> <p>Further research has led to the identification of other types of neurons, including <em>polysemantic neurons</em> <d-cite key="Olah20"></d-cite>, which respond to multiple unrelated inputs, and <em>knowledge neurons</em> <d-cite key="Dong22"></d-cite>, which store factual knowledge in a key-value memory-like fashion in BERT.

These findings collectively suggest that LLMs surely employ a complex, distributed architecture to store and represent knowledge, with different functional zones specializing in specific information.</p> <p>The idea that linguistic concepts are represented in a <em>vector space</em> within LLMs aligns with the <em>linear representation hypothesis</em>, where high-level concepts are represented linearly as directions in their representation space <d-cite key="Jiang24"></d-cite>.

RAG framework answers a question in four steps: the user proposes a query, the system retrieves the relevant content from private knowledge bases, combines it with the user query as context, and finally asks the LLM to generate an answer. This process mirrors the typical cognitive process of encountering a problem, including consulting relevant references and subsequently deriving an answer. In this framework, the pivotal component is the accurate retrieval of pertinent information, which is critical for the efficacy of the RAG model.</p> <p>Most professional documents are mainly stored in PDFs, the low accuracy of PDF parsing significantly impacts the effectiveness of professional knowledge-based question-answering . The process of retrieval from PDF files is fraught with challenges <d-cite key="Lin24"></d-cite>, Common issues include inaccuracies in text extraction and disarray in the row-column relationships of tables inside PDF files.

Founded in September 2022, EIE aspires to cultivate exemplary future engineers and lead innovative practices in new engineering education.

In this section, we begin to build the RAG-based EIE knowledge base with the help of LangChain-Chatchat, aiming to construct an enhancing tool for our digital avatar project. The LLM is enriched with information relevant to EIE, and thus we need to collect data in Markdown format to construct our corpora.</p> <p>Our curated corpus includes a brief introduction to EIE, party building work, student activities in 2024, laboratory construction, campus life, and curriculum. Although directly uploading documents when loading knowledge base files can achieve basic question answering, the effect cannot be maximized. Therefore, we performed preprocessing work on the Markdown files, which includes:</p> <ol> <li>Formatting text or PDF documents according to the Markdown format.</li> <li>Typesetting the key points of the documents in Markdown format.</li> <li>Placing duplicate content files under the same topic file to facilitate the retrieval process of RAG and increase the probability of LLMs retrieving desired answers.</li> <li>Simplifying ambiguous sentences or long, difficult sentences in the knowledge base to avoid statements that can easily cause misunderstandings by LLMs, reducing the probability of LLM answering errors due to retrieving ambiguous sentences.</li> <li>Deleting special symbols or redundant information to facilitate the text vectorization process.</li> </ol> <p>Experience has shown that the modified Markdown files have a higher recall rate and better answering effect when embedded in the LLMs’ knowledge base. The preprocessing steps ensure that the knowledge base is well-structured, concise, and free from ambiguity, thereby improving the overall performance of the RAG-based EIE knowledge base in the digital avatar project.</p> <p>By following these guidelines and leveraging the power of the RAG framework, we create a robust and efficient knowledge base that enhances the capabilities of our digital avatar.</p> </details> <details><summary><strong>Chunking strategy</strong>:</summary> <p>Chunking is a critical preprocessing step in corpora’s embedding process, where large texts are segmented into manageable pieces that better align with user queries in semantic search applications. Effective chunking ensures that each piece is semantically cohesive, minimizing dependencies on the surrounding context, which enhances the retrieval accuracy. The challenge lies in determining the optimal chunk size; too large or too small can lead to imprecise search results or missed opportunities to display relevant information. This process directly impacts the quality of information retrieval by ensuring that search results closely match the query’s intent, thus addressing user needs more precisely.</p> </details> <details><summary><strong>Vectorization and Database Indexing with Faiss</strong>:</summary> <p>After chunking, text data undergoes vectorization, converting it into numerical vector matrices. Our implementation uses FlagEmbedding <d-cite key="bge-embedding"></d-cite> to map text to low-dimensional, dense vectors suitable for retrieval, classification, and semantic search tasks. This embedding excels in matching short queries with longer documents.</p> <p>Faiss <d-cite key="Faiss"></d-cite>, developed by Facebook AI Research, efficiently handles billions of vectors, facilitating rapid retrieval in large-scale systems. Integrated into the RAG framework, Faiss enhances the model’s ability to quickly fetch and incorporate pertinent information into generated responses. This integration ensures the retrieval component supports the generative model, maximizing output accuracy and relevance.</p> <p>Vectors are indexed and stored in a vector database system tailored for RAG applications. We chose Faiss for its efficiency in similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, which is crucial for managing extensive datasets typical in applications. Faiss supports $L 2$-normalization and cosine similarities and is optimized for both CPU and GPU environments, ensuring efficient data handling. Incorporating Faiss provides advanced indexing and search capabilities, offering a robust solution for vector database management and significantly improving our RAG system’s performance.</p> </details> <details><summary><strong>Design of prompt templates</strong>:</summary> <p>The design of prompt templates is crucial in influencing the accuracy of model outputs in RAG scenarios. Effective prompts typically include task descriptions, background knowledge retrieved from databases, and specific user queries. Our experimental findings suggest that the art of prompt design is often reliant on personal experience, lacking a definitive methodological framework. Consequently, prompts require continuous optimization based on the model’s real-time outputs to enhance their effectiveness.</p> </details> <details><summary><strong>Markdown format</strong>:</summary> <p>To optimize the utilization of the comprehensive knowledge base specific to the National Elite Institute of Engineering (EIE), which includes data on academic curricula, faculty research interests, laboratory resources, and industrial partnerships, we have adopted the Markdown format. This relatively rich database not only informs the LLMs but also ensures the outputs are factually accurate and contextually relevant. Given the clarity, readability, and structural organization afforded by Markdown, it facilitates and enhances information retrieval, making it a suitable choice for formatting.</p> <p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed to format plain text using a simple syntax. It is widely used for creating structured documents on platforms such as GitHub, Jupyter notebooks, and various content management systems. When feeding data into our case, using markdown format provides several benefits:</p> <ul> <li> <p>structured and rich content: Markdown enables the organization of information into headings, lists, tables, and other structured elements, aiding in the preservation of context and ease of understanding. Moreover, Markdown supports basic formatting options like bold, italics, links, and code blocks, Markdown enriches the context provided to the language model.</p> </li> <li> <p>embedding links and references: The ability to embed hyperlinks, footnotes, and references in Markdown is crucial in RAG scenarios, as it allows for referencing external sources or including additional contextual details.</p> </li> <li> <p>ease of authoring: Markdown is not only human-readable but also straightforward to author, allowing content creators to efficiently produce well-structured documents without the need for complex formatting tools.</p> </li> <li> <p>chunking: In RAG systems, chunking—otherwise known as the process of breaking down extensive documents—makes the data more manageable and processable.</p> </li> </ul> </details> <details><summary><strong>Summarization</strong>:</summary> <p>In summary, the integration of localized knowledge bases with LLMs aims to address the challenges associated with the “black box” nature of these models. The primary objective of this thesis is to enhance the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs by integrating them with localized knowledge bases. The conceptual framework for this integration is rooted in the development and implementation of a RAG framework. This model leverages both the generative capabilities of LLMs and the precise information retrieval from knowledge bases to produce contextually relevant and accurate outputs.</p> </details> <h1 id="5-theoretical-analysis-">5. Theoretical Analysis <chap5></chap5> </h1> <p>In this chapter, we delve into the mathematical analysis underlying transformer architectures, exploring the internal residual stream and representation space, and therefore provide a simplified mathematical summary of the intrinsic workings of LLMs.</p> <h2 id="51-mathematical-models-and-mechanistic-interpretability-">5.1 Mathematical Models and Mechanistic Interpretability <sec3.1></sec3.1> </h2> <div class="l-screen"> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BT_LLM/LLM_flow.svg-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/LLM_flow.svg-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/LLM_flow.svg-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/BT_LLM/LLM_flow.svg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Figure 5.1 </strong> The GPT model takes as input a sequence of one-hot encoded token representations, which are then transformed through the word embedding layer. These embeddings are subsequently augmented with positional encodings to incorporate information about the token's position within the sequence. The resulting position-aware embeddings are then propagated through the transformer blocks, which constitute the core of the GPT architecture. The outputs from the transformer blocks undergo a final linear transformation, mapping them back into the vocabulary space, yielding a sequence of transformed vectors, known as <em>logits</em>. To obtain a probability distribution over the vocabulary, the final logit vector is passed through a `softmax` activation function, which produces a probability distribution over the vocabulary, indicating the likelihood of each word being the next component in the sequence. This figure is derived from and inspired by the latest research <d-cite key="Wang20,Liao24"></d-cite> </div> <p><em><strong>Mechanistic interpretability</strong></em><d-footnote>For more information, please refer to Neel Nanda's mechanistic interpretability quickstart guide, available at https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/quickstart .</d-footnote>, a subfield of explainable AI, aims to reverse-engineer model components into human-understandable algorithms, uncovering the causal processes within the LLMs that lead to its actions. Mechanistic interpretability in LLMs involves unpacking the internal processes and data flows that drive their operations. This clarity is crucial not only for trust in their applications but also for enhancing their functionality with localized knowledge integration.</p> <p>Autoregressive models predict subsequent tokens based solely on preceding ones, followed by a <em>decoder-only</em> architecture. This architecture uses the <em>self-attention</em> based mechanism, to process the input sequences through a series of multiple transformer layers, where each layer applies masked <em>multi-head</em> self-attention followed by a fully connected feed-forward network, capturing long-range dependencies and producing coherent output tokens. Readers may refer to Figure 5.1 for an illustrative and intuitive understanding.</p> <p>The internal state of the transformer, known as the <em><strong>residual stream</strong></em>, is the summation of the outputs from all preceding components <d-cite key="Elhage21"></d-cite>, including attention heads, transformer layers, and individual neurons. We now present a mathematical analysis and theoretical exploration of the internal residual stream of large language models.</p> <p>At first, we define shorthand notation \(\left\{s_{(i)}\right\}_{i=1}^{n}\) to denote sequence, and as for each \(\left\{s_{(i)}\right\}_{i=1}^{n}\) in set \(S\), we use \(S^\star := \bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{N}} S^n\) to denote the set of sequences with arbitrary length \(n\in \mathbb{N}\) , and \(|S|\) as the length of the set $S$. Notice that in practical settings, though sequences can theoretically extend indefinitely, a maximum context length is imposed by computational constraints. Further, we here define mapping $\mathcal{F}^\star:S_1^\star \rightarrow S_2^\star$ to represent an entrywise function: \(\begin{equation} \mathcal{F}\left[\left\{s_{(i)}\right\}_{i=1}^{n}\right]:=\left\{\mathcal{F}\left[s_{(i)}\right]\right\}_{i=1}^{n} \label{eq:5.1} \end{equation}\)</p> <p><strong>Tokenization</strong> $\mathcal{K}$. The sequences of characters \(\left\{a_{(i)}\right\}_{i=1}^{p}\) from a given alphabet $\mathbb{A}$ form a specific word. We here define the injective mapping \(\mathcal{K}^{\star}: \mathbb{A}^{\star} \rightarrow \mathbb{T}^{\star}\), which maps the input texts to a sequence of tokens defined by \(\left\{t_{(i)}\right\}_{i=1}^{q}\), and typically \(\mathbb{T}:=\{1,2, \ldots,|\mathbb{T}|\}\). The process of tokenization encodes each subword \(a_{i}\) individually, which is then mapped as tokens and thus the input sequence henceforth segmented. For instance, the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tokenizer</a> of GPT-4 splits the term “cohomology” into the subwords: “co” (prefix), “hom”, and “ology” (suffix).</p> <p>While these methods provide a convenient way to segment text, they do not capture the underlying semantic information. Popular subword tokenization methods, such as byte pair encoding <d-cite key="Sennrich16"></d-cite> and unigram language model <d-cite key="Kudo18"></d-cite>, are adaptations of data compression algorithms that rely on word character co-occurrence statistics in a given text corpora.</p> <p><strong>Embedding</strong> \(\mathcal{E}\). To enable neural networks to effectively process and learn from the complex linguistic data, token sequences \(\left\{t_{(i)}\right\}_{i=1}^{q}\) are then embedded into a high dimensional Euclidean space \(\mathbb{E}:=\mathbb{R}^{d}\) through dense vector representations. Formally, the embedding function \(\mathcal{E}:\mathbb{T} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}\) maps each token \(t_{(i)}\) from the token vocabulary \(\mathbb{T}\) to a $d$-dimensional dense vector \(\boldsymbol{e}_{(j)}\), such that norm \(\left\|\mathcal{E}\left(t_{\alpha}\right)-\mathcal{E}\left(t_{\beta}\right)\right\|\) corresponds to the linguistic similarity of the subwords represented by the tokens \(t_{\alpha}\) and \(t_{\beta}\).</p> <p>These embedded vectors \(\left\{\boldsymbol{e}_{(j)}\right\}_{j=1}^{r}\) are stored in a matrix \(\boldsymbol{E}\), which \(\in \mathbb{R}^{\|\mathbb{T}\| \times d}\), where each row represents the embedding of a specific token. The most famous example <d-cite key="CohnT15"></d-cite> is listed below; one can read Section 5.2 for more analysis :</p> \[\begin{equation} \tilde{\mathcal{E}}(\text { 'king' })-\tilde{\mathcal{E}}(\text { 'queen' }) \approx \tilde{\mathcal{E}}(\text { 'man' })-\tilde{\mathcal{E}}(\text { 'woman' }) \label{eq:5.2} \end{equation}\] <p>The goal of embedding is to represent linguistic similarity between subwords through the distance between their corresponding embedding vectors, and Euclidean space makes it compatible with a wide range of linear algebraic operations. This approach, as opposed to one-hot encoding, where each word would be represented as a sparse vector of size \(\|\mathbb{T}\|\) with all zeros except for one element, results in capable of representing the various aspects of word relationships, both monolingual <d-cite key="Mikolov2013,Kocmi2017"></d-cite> and bilingual <d-cite key="Luong2015,Wang2019"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>Positional Encoding</strong> \(\mathcal{P}\). Since the embeddings \(\mathcal{E}\left(t_{(i)}\right)\) do not contain any positional information, one can typically add positional encodings, which is the map \(\mathcal{P}^{\star}: \mathbb{E}^{\star} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}^{\star}\). In the absolute position encoding setting, the commonly used form is the addition:</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathcal{P}^{\star}\left(\left\{\boldsymbol{e}_{(j)}\right\}_{j=1}^{r}\right):=\left\{\boldsymbol{e}_{(j)}+\boldsymbol{p}_{(j)}\right\}_{j=1}^{r} \end{equation}\] <p>where \(p: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}\) is an injective function. In the learned variant of absolute position encoding, \(\boldsymbol{p}_{(j)}\) is learned during training. In the sinusoidal variant, denote \(\left(\boldsymbol{p}_{(j)}\right)\) as the $s$-th component of the vector, then \(\boldsymbol{p}_{(j)}\) is commonly computed as:</p> \[\begin{equation} \left(\boldsymbol{p}_{(j)}\right)_{s}= \begin{cases}\sin \left(\frac{j}{M^{\frac{s}{d}}}\right) \quad s=2 k \\ \cos \left(\frac{j}{M^{\frac{s-1}{d}}}\right) \quad s=2 k-1\end{cases} \end{equation}\] <p>where \(s \in [0,d-2]\), and \(M=10^4\) are fixed <d-cite key="Vaswani17"></d-cite>. However, in the latest research <d-cite key="Haviv22,Reddy2023"></d-cite>, explicit position encodings are not essential for decoder-only transformers to generalize well to longer sequences, since they can learn positional information implicitly. However, for masked language modeling transformers like BERT, explicit position encodings are necessary for effective generalization.</p> <p>So far, the text \(\left\{a_{(i)}\right\}_{i=1}^{p}\in \mathbb{A}^{\star}\) has been transformed into a sequence of embeddings through three steps: tokenization \(\mathcal{K}\), embedding \(\mathcal{E}\), and positional encoding \(\mathcal{P}\) :</p> \[\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{x}:=\left(\mathcal{P}^{\star} \circ \mathcal{E}^{\star} \circ \mathcal{K}^{\star}\right)\left(\left\{a_{(i)}\right\}_{i=1}^{p}\right)=\left\{\boldsymbol{e}_{(j)}+\boldsymbol{p}_{(j)}\right\}_{j=1}^{r} \end{equation}\] <p>where \(\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{E}^{\star}\), and the length of which depends on both the tokenization algorithm and the choice of text.</p> <p><strong>Transformer</strong> \(\mathcal{T}\). The transformer can be represented as a neural network \(\mathcal{T}^{\star}: \mathbb{E}^{\star} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}^{\star}\), which maps a sequence of embeddings \(\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(t)}\right\}_{t=1}^{n}\) to another equal-length sequence, preserving the contextual information. For autoregressive tasks, the model is designed to ensure that each element of its output, e.g. $i$-th element of \(\mathcal{T}\left(\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(t)}\right\}_{t&gt;i=1}^{n}\right)\), depends only on the previous embedded tokens \(\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(t)}\right\}_{t=1}^{t \leq i}\) and is independent of \(\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(t)}\right\}_{t=1}^{t \geq 1}\), which creates the masked structure that produces one-way information flow.</p> <p>The transformer is typically defined by a composition of \(L \in \mathbb{N}\) residual blocks, consisting of self-attention mapping \(\mathcal{A}^{(l)}\), entrywise applied normalizing layers \(\mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{A}}^{(l)}, \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{M}}^{(l)}\), and multiplayer perceptrons (MLP) layer \(\mathcal{M}^{(l)}\) :</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ \mathcal{T}^{\star}:=\left[\left(I+\mathcal{M}^{(l) \star} \circ \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{M}}^{(l) \star}\right) \circ\left(I+\mathcal{A}^{(l)} \circ \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{A}}^{(l) \star}\right)\right] \circ \dots \\ \circ\left[\left(I+\mathcal{M}^{(2) \star} \circ \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{M}}^{(2) \star}\right) \circ\left(I+\mathcal{A}^{(2)} \circ \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{A}}^{(2) \star}\right)\right] \circ\left[\left(I+\mathcal{M}^{(1) \star} \circ \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{M}}^{(1) \star}\right) \circ\left(I+\mathcal{A}^{(1)} \circ \mathcal{N}_{\mathcal{A}}^{(1) \star}\right)\right] } \label{eq:5.6} \end{equation}\] <p>where \(I\) denotes the identity mapping, inspired by <em>residual neural networks</em> (ResNet) <d-cite key="He2015"></d-cite>’s unique <em>residual connection</em> design, \(l \in [0,L]\) denotes the specific $l$-th layer, and the addition here is an entrywise function.The upper indices of the layers $\mathcal{N}^{(l)}, \mathcal{M}^{(l)}, \mathcal{A}^{(l)}$ signify the use of distinct trainable parameters within each layer.</p> <p><strong>Transformer: Layer Normalization</strong> \(\mathcal{N}\). The normalizing layer can be interpreted as a re-parametrization with a learnable mean and standard deviation to stabilize training. In its original formulation <d-cite key="Ba2016"></d-cite>, \(\mathcal{N}: \mathbb{E} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}\) is introduced in terms of the mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ of an input feature vector $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{E}$ and denote its $i$-th component $x_{i}$, then :</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{x})=\frac{\boldsymbol{x}-\mu}{\sigma} \\ \text { where } \mu=\frac{1}{d} \sum_{i}^{d} x_{i} \text { and } \sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{d} \sum_{i=1}^{d}\left(x_{i}-\mu^{2}\right)} } \label{eq:5.7} \end{equation}\] <p>Recently works <d-cite key="Brody2023,Molina23"></d-cite> notice that vector \((\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})\) is proved to be orthogonal to the \(\overrightarrow{\boldsymbol{1}}\), where \(\boldsymbol{\mu}= [\mu, \ldots, \mu], \overrightarrow{\mathbf{1}}=[1, \ldots, 1]\) and \(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \overrightarrow{\mathbf{1}} \in \mathbb{E}\). Moreover, we can henceforth derive the projection of \(\boldsymbol{x}\) onto the hyperplane \(\mathcal{H}\) defined by \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \overrightarrow{\mathbf{1}}\) :</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ \operatorname{proj}_{\mathcal{H}}(\boldsymbol{x})= &amp; \boldsymbol{x}-\operatorname{proj}_{\mathcal{H}}\left(\boldsymbol{x}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \overrightarrow{\mathbf{1}}\right) \\ = &amp; \boldsymbol{x}-\frac{\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathbf{1}}}{d} \cdot \overrightarrow{\mathbf{1}}=\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu} } \label{eq:5.8} \end{equation}\] <p>and thus, combine the result of Equation \eqref{eq:5.7} and Equation \eqref{eq:5.8} , we can reformulate layer normalization \(\mathcal{N}\) as :</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ &amp; \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{x})=\frac{\gamma(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})}{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}+\beta=\gamma \cdot \frac{\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{d}} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{d}\left(x_{i}-\mu\right)^{2}}}+\beta \\ &amp; =\gamma \cdot \frac{\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu}}{\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\right)\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu}\|_{2}}+\beta=\gamma \cdot \frac{\sqrt{d} \cdot \operatorname{proj}_{\mathcal{H}}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\left\|\operatorname{proj}_{\mathcal{H}}(\boldsymbol{x})\right\|_{2}}+\beta } \label{eq:5.9} \end{equation}\] <p>where \(\gamma, \beta \in \mathbb{E}\) are defined as the gain and bias learnable parameters. From a geometric viewpoint, layer normalization \(\mathcal{N}\) projects \(\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{E}\) onto the hyperplane \(\mathcal{H}\) perpendicular to \(\overrightarrow{\mathbf{1}}\), and normalizes the projection such that it lies on the surface of the hyper-sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\) of radius \(\sqrt{d}\). Also, considering the property of transformer-based architectures, all intermediate layers project onto the same hyper-sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\). The parameter \(\gamma\) scales each coordinate axis of \(\mathbb{E}\) independently, transforming the hyper-sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\) into a hyper-ellipsoid, and the bias term \(\beta\) shifts the center of the hyper-ellipsoid from the origin.</p> <p>Moreover, according to the latest work <d-cite key="Brody2023"></d-cite>, both the projection and scaling procedures of \(\mathcal{N}\) enhance the expressivity of the subsequent multi-head attention layer. By applying the projection operation \(\operatorname{proj}_{\mathcal{H}}(\boldsymbol{x})\), transformers enable the attention mechanism to create an attention query that attends to all keys equally, simplifying the learning process for the attention mechanism. The scaling procedure allows each key to potentially receive the highest attention, avoiding situations where certain keys may become unselectable.</p> <p><strong>Transformer: Multilayer Percpetrons</strong> \(\mathcal{M}\). The MLP layer is a standard feed-forward neural network consisting of compositions of affine mappings \({ }_{m}^{n} \mathcal{L}^{(l)}: \mathbb{R}^{m} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n}\) and Lipschitz functions \(\sigma(\cdot): \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\). We first define the affine mapping \({ }_{m}^{n} \mathcal{L}^{(l)}(t):=\boldsymbol{W}^{(l)} t+b^{(l)}\), where the weight matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}\) and the bias vector \(b^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}\). A typical MLP \(\mathcal{M}: \mathbb{E} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}\) used in transformers is then:</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathcal{M}:={ }_{d^{\prime}}^{d} \mathcal{L}^{(l)} \circ \sigma \circ{ }_{d}^{d^{\prime}} \mathcal{L}^{(l)} \end{equation}\] <p>where $d^{\prime} \in \mathbb{N}$, usually $d^{\prime}&gt;d$, and $l$ here indicates layer number. Typically, one considers ReLU, GELU, or sigmoid for the choice of activation function \(\sigma\) <d-cite key="Nwankpa2018"></d-cite> flexibly. The parameters of MLP are learnt using gradient-based optimization algorithms with the gradients being computed via back-propagation.</p> <p><strong>Transformer: Self-attention</strong> \(\mathcal{A}\). As shown in Equation \eqref{eq:5.6}, the self-attention layer \(\mathcal{A}: \mathbb{E}^{\star} \rightarrow \mathbb{E}^{\star}\) is the only layer that combines embeddings of different tokens, which means \(\mathcal{A}\) attends to other tokens. Recall that we use \(\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}\right\}_{j=1}^{n}\) to denote the given input sequence of length $n$, then the self-attention mechanism is defined as follows:</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathcal{A}\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{W}_{Q}, \boldsymbol{W}_{K}, \boldsymbol{W}_{V}\right):=\operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{\boldsymbol{Q} \boldsymbol{K}^{T}}{\sqrt{d}}\right) \boldsymbol{V} \label{eq:5.11} \end{equation}\] <p>where \(\boldsymbol{X}=\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}\right\}_{j=1}^{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}\) for conciseness, and</p> \[\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{Q}:=\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \boldsymbol{W}_{Q} \quad \boldsymbol{K}:=\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \boldsymbol{W}_{K} \quad \boldsymbol{V}:=\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \boldsymbol{W}_{V} \label{eq:5.12} \end{equation}\] <p>To normalize the probabilities, we here introduce the softmax function softmax : $\mathbb{R}^{\star} \rightarrow[0,1]^{\star}$ denoted as:</p> \[\begin{equation} \operatorname{softmax}\left(\boldsymbol{x}_{(i)}\right):=\frac{\exp \left(\boldsymbol{x}_{(i)}\right)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} \exp \left(\boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}\right)} \label{eq:5.13} \end{equation}\] <p>Here, \(\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}, \boldsymbol{W}_{K} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}\) and \(\boldsymbol{W}_{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times v}\) are projection matrices from \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\) to an intermediate dimension \(\mathbb{R}^{k}\) and value dimension \(\mathbb{R}^{v}\). Notices that for the settings of multi-head attention, the projection matrices can be written as \(\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}^{(i)}, \boldsymbol{W}_{K}^{(i)}, \boldsymbol{W}_{V}^{(i)}\), where \(i \in[1, \ldots, h]\) and $h$ is the number of heads. According to the original design of transformers <d-cite key="Vaswani17"></d-cite>, the value dimension $v$ is commonly equal to $k$, and an extra projection matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}_{O} \in \mathbb{R}^{h k \times d}\) is introduced to combine information from all heads. Multi-head attention enables the model to simultaneously capture information from diverse representation subspaces across different positions, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of inputs. We therefore derive the mechanism of multi-head self-attention as:</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ \operatorname{Head}_{i}:=\mathcal{A}\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{W}_{Q}^{(i)}, \boldsymbol{W}_{K}^{(i)}, \boldsymbol{W}_{V}^{(i)}\right) \\ \operatorname{MultiHead}(\boldsymbol{X}):=\sum_{i=1}^{h} \operatorname{head}_{i} \boldsymbol{W}_{O}^{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{h} \mathcal{A}\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{W}_{Q}^{(i)}, \boldsymbol{W}_{K}^{(i)}, \boldsymbol{W}_{V}^{(i)}\right) \boldsymbol{W}_{O}^{i} } \label{eq:5.14} \end{equation}\] <p>where \(\boldsymbol{W}_{O}^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}\) denotes an element of the partition of matrix \(\boldsymbol{W}_{O} \in \mathbb{R}^{h k \times d}\) alongside the row dimension. By combining the Equation \eqref{eq:5.11} to Equation \eqref{eq:5.14} , we can derive a simple form notation:</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ \operatorname{MultiHead}(\boldsymbol{X})=\sum_{i=1}^{h} \operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \boldsymbol{W}_{Q}^{(i)} \boldsymbol{W}_{K}^{(i) T} \boldsymbol{X}}{\sqrt{d}}\right) \boldsymbol{X}^{T} \boldsymbol{W}_{V}^{(i)} \boldsymbol{W}_{O}^{(i)} \\ =\sum_{i=1}^{h} \operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{\boldsymbol{X}^{T} \boldsymbol{W}_{Q K}^{(i)} \boldsymbol{X}}{\sqrt{d}}\right) \boldsymbol{X}^{T} \boldsymbol{W}_{V O}^{(i)} } \label{eq:5.15} \end{equation}\] <p>where \(\boldsymbol{W}_{Q K}^{(i)}=\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}^{(i)} \boldsymbol{W}_{K}^{(i) T}, \boldsymbol{W}_{V O}^{(i)}=\boldsymbol{V}_{Q}^{(i)} \boldsymbol{W}_{O}^{(i)}\), and \(\boldsymbol{W}_{Q K}^{(i)}, \boldsymbol{W}_{V O}^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) are both low-rank virtual matrices as previous works shown <d-cite key="Dar2022,Elhage21"></d-cite>.</p> <p>On a high level, the term $\left(\frac{Q K^{T}}{\sqrt{d}}\right)$ can be interpreted as measuring the similarities between the embeddings of the $i$-th query and the $j$-th key across all tokens. Consequently, softmax mapping softmax $\left(\frac{Q K^{T}}{\sqrt{d}}\right)$ can be understood as representing the probabilities distribution that the $i$-th query will attend to or focus on the $j$-th key.</p> <p>The scaling factor $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$ is introduced to mitigate the effect of large magnitudes in the dot products, which can cause the softmax function to generate extreme probabilities when $d$ is high. By scaling the dot products by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$, the self-attention mechanism becomes more stable and less sensitive to the embedding dimensionality.</p> <p>In summary, the self-attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically focus on different parts of the input sequence, emphasizing the most relevant information for predicting subsequent elements.</p> <p><strong>Prediction Head</strong> \(\mathcal{H}\). The prediction head or un-embedding layer can be represented as the mapping \(\mathcal{H}: \mathbb{E}^{\star} \rightarrow \Delta^{\gamma}\), where</p> \[\begin{equation} \Delta^{\gamma}:=\left\{\boldsymbol{u} \in[0,1]^{\gamma} \mid \sum_{i=1}^{\gamma}\left\|\boldsymbol{u}_{i}\right\|=1\right\} \label{eq:5.16} \end{equation}\] <p>denotes the probability simplex in \(\mathbb{R}^{\gamma}\), which is a geometric representation of all possible distributions of probabilities across $\gamma$ different outputs. The prediction head maps the sequence of transformed embeddings \(\boldsymbol{Y}:=\mathcal{T}(\boldsymbol{X})\) to a vector \(\boldsymbol{u} \in \Delta^{\gamma}\), where \(\boldsymbol{u}_{i}\) denotes the probability of predicting the next token \(t_{(q+1)} \in \mathbb{T}\). As the transformed embedding of the last tokens, e.g. \(\boldsymbol{y}_{n+1}\), contains information about the entire input sequence \(\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(t)}\right\}_{i=1}^{n}\), a straightforward approach is to use a linear mapping followed by softmax layer to ensure \(\boldsymbol{u}\) lies inside \(\Delta^{\gamma}\) :</p> \[\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{u}:=\left(\operatorname{softmax} \circ_{d}^{\gamma} \mathcal{L}\right)\left(\boldsymbol{y}_{(n+1)}\right) \label{5.17} \end{equation}\] <p><strong>Sampling</strong> $\mathcal{S}$. Sampling methods $\mathcal{S}: \Delta^{\gamma} \rightarrow \mathbb{T}$ are the decoding strategies for language models to generate coherent, diverse, and contextually relevant texts, which determine how the final prediction for the next token $t_{(q+1)} \in \mathbb{T}$ is selected by sampling from the probability distribution over all possible tokens. Choosing the appropriate sampling method helps to decrease the occurrence of text degeneration, which implies the production of repetitive, incoherent, or generic texts <d-cite key="ChoiY2019"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Several methods are commonly used in text generation, including beam search, top- $k$ sampling, and nucleus sampling <d-cite key="ChoiY2019"></d-cite>. The simplest option is greedy sampling, which always selects the token with the highest probability as the next token.</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathcal{S}(\boldsymbol{Y})=t_{(q+1)}:=\underset{i=1, \ldots, \gamma}{\operatorname{argmax}}\left(\left\|\boldsymbol{u}_{i}\right\|\right) \end{equation}\] <p>To sum up, the aforementioned operations can be iteratively applied to the augmented token sequence \(\left\{t_{(i)}\right\}_{i=1}^{q+1}\) repeatedly, thereby generating successive token \(t_{(q+2)}\) until the stopping criterion is finally satisfied:</p> \[\begin{equation} t_{(q+2)}:=\left(\mathcal{S} \circ \mathcal{H} \circ \mathcal{T}^{\star} \circ \mathcal{P}^{\star} \circ \mathcal{E}^{\star}\right)\left(\left\{t_{(i)}\right\}_{i=1}^{q+1}\right) \end{equation}\] <p>In summary, tokens are first embedded as particles in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and then projected onto the hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, travelling around its surface, thus completing a “walk of sentences” in response to the initial input of LLMs. The trajectory of the particle flow is determined by each layer of the transformer, which continually transforms “meanings” of particles. Meanwhile, the cumulative residual stream encodes information that has been progressively accumulated and transformed throughout the various blocks of the transformer’s architecture as the “communication channels” <d-cite key="Elhage21"></d-cite>.</p> <h2 id="52-concepts-representation-within-llms-">5.2 Concepts Representation within LLMs <sec5.2></sec5.2> </h2> <p>LLMs demonstrate a remarkable ability to answer questions and understand the underlying semantic intentions, which then raises questions about how knowledge are stored inside LLMs. Can we draw parallels between the memory circuits of the human brain with LLMs? Or, do LLMs mimic the functionality of biological neurons to store information?</p> <p><strong>Linear Concept Representation</strong>. We propose a mathematical language to formalize the inner workings of semantical knowledge storage of LLMs. Continuing along the perspective of Equation \eqref{eq:5.2}, we further investigate the hypothesis that linguistic concepts are represented in the internal vector space within LLMs.</p> <p>Let $\mathbb{V}=\mathbb{R}^{d}$ denote the vector space that concepts are embedded into. We define the set of output words from LLMs as $\mathbb{W}=\left{w_{1}, w_{2}, \ldots, w_{n}\right}$, where each $w_{i}$ is a word from the dictionary $\mathbb{W}$. We denote the extended version of embedding mapping $\tilde{\mathcal{E}}: \mathbb{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{W}$ and un-embedding mapping $\tilde{\mathcal{E}}^{-1}: \mathbb{W} \rightarrow \mathbb{V}$ as follows:</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ &amp; \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{i}\right):=(\mathcal{T} \circ \mathcal{P} \circ \mathcal{E} \circ \mathcal{K})\left(w_{i}\right) \\ &amp; \tilde{\mathcal{E}}^{-1}\left(\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{i}\right)\right):=(\mathcal{S} \circ \mathcal{H})\left(\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{i}\right)\right) } \label{5.20} \end{equation}\] <p>and it is trivial to show that:</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(\text { ' word' }\right)=\left(\mathcal{T}^{\star} \circ \mathcal{P}^{\star} \circ \mathcal{E}^{\star} \circ \mathcal{K}^{\star}\right)(\text { 'word' }) \in \mathbb{V} \\ \left(\tilde{\mathcal{E}}^{-1} \circ \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\right)(\text { 'word' })=\text { 'word' }^{\mathbb{W}} } \end{equation}\] <p>For simplicity, we restrict focus on binary concepts, which are the vectors composed of their corresponding counterfactual parts. We denote the counterfactual parts as \(\delta_{+}\) or \(\delta_{-}\), where e.g. \(\delta_{+} \in \text\{ 'man', 'king', 'actor', \ldots \} \subset \mathbb{W}\) and \(\delta_{-} \in\text\{ 'woman', 'queen', 'actress', \ldots\} \subset \mathbb{W}\). The positive span <d-footnote>The term "positive" here only signifies the "direction" of the concept vectors. Similarly, the negative span of a binary concept vector can be defined as: $$\operatorname{span}^{-}\left(\vec{b}_{i}\right):=\left\{\mu \vec{b}_{i} \in \mathbb{V} \mid \mu \leqslant 0\right\}$$</d-footnote> of a binary concept vector \(\vec{b}_{i}\) is defined as:</p> \[\begin{equation} \operatorname{span}^{+}\left(\vec{b}_{i}\right):=\left\{\lambda \vec{b}_{i} \in \mathbb{V} \mid \lambda \geqslant 0\right\} \end{equation}\] <p>We then say binary concept vectors \(\vec{b}_{i}, \vec{b}_{j} \in \mathbb{V}\) are linearly separable if and only if their counterfactual parts \(\delta_{+}^{(i)}, \delta_{-}^{(i)}, \delta_{+}^{(j)}, \delta_{-}^{(j)}\) belong to the same separable category. The binary concept vector \(\vec{b}_{i}\) is then defined as the difference between the extended embeddings of its counterfactual parts:</p> \[\begin{equation} \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(\delta_{+}^{(i)}\right)-\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(\delta_{-}^{(i)}\right) \in \operatorname{span}^{+}\left(\vec{b}_{i}\right) \label{eq:5.23} \end{equation}\] <p>Thus Equation \eqref{eq:5.2} can be re-interpreted as the expression of linearly separable binary concept (here means “gender”):</p> \[\begin{equation} \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(\delta_{+}^{\text {(gender) }}\right)-\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(\delta_{-}^{(\text {gender) }}\right) \in \operatorname{span}^{+}\left(\vec{b}_{(\text {gender })}\right) \label{eq:5.24} \end{equation}\] <p><strong>Linearity</strong>. As we have shown in Equation \eqref{eq:5.16} and Equation \eqref{eq:5.17}, LLMs produce the probability distribution over different outputs, which is proportional to the softmax of attention scores. LLMs digest context text \(w_j\), then sample the output text \(w_i\) by the mechanism of softmax:</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ P\left(w_{i} \mid w_{j}\right) &amp; :=\operatorname{softmax}\left(\left\langle\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right), \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{i}\right)\right\rangle\right) \\ &amp; =\frac{e^{\left\langle\tilde{\varepsilon}\left(w_{j}\right), \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{i}\right)\right\rangle}}{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{|\mathbb{W}|} e^{\left\langle\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right), \tilde{\mathcal{\varepsilon}}\left(w_{k}\right)\right\rangle}} } \label{eq:5.25} \end{equation}\] <p>Before we draw the conclusion of linearity, we first need to define an inner product on \(\mathbb{V}\) to measure the similarity or projection between vectors in the representation space. Let \(\boldsymbol{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) be a symmetric positive definite matrix, and define the inner product \(\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle_{B}: \mathbb{V} \times \mathbb{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) as follows:</p> <p>Notices that the inner product, induced by matrix \(\boldsymbol{B}\), should satisfy the following properties for \(\vec{b}_{i}, \vec{b}_{j} \in \mathbb{V}, \alpha \in \mathbb{R}\):</p> \[\begin{equation} \left\{\begin{array}{l} \left\langle\vec{b}_{i}, \vec{b}_{j}\right\rangle_{B}=\left\langle\vec{b}_{j}, \vec{b}_{i}\right\rangle_{B} \tag{5.26}\\ \left\langle\alpha \vec{b}_{i}, \vec{b}_{j}\right\rangle_{B}=\alpha\left\langle\vec{b}_{i}, \vec{b}_{j}\right\rangle_{B} \\ \left\langle\vec{b}_{i}+\vec{b}_{k}, \vec{b}_{j}\right\rangle_{B}=\left\langle\vec{b}_{i}, \vec{b}_{j}\right\rangle_{B}+\left\langle\vec{b}_{k}, \vec{b}_{j}\right\rangle_{B} \\ \left\langle\vec{b}_{j}, \vec{b}_{j}\right\rangle_{B}&gt;0, \text { for all } \vec{b}_{j} \in \mathbb{V} \backslash\{0\} \end{array}\right. \label{eq:5.26} \end{equation}\] <p>As we have the notion of inner product, considering \(w_{i} \in\left\{\delta_{+}^{(k)}, \delta_{-}^{(k)}\right\}$, e.g. $w_{i}=\delta_{+}^{(k)}\), then \(w_{i}\) implies the existence of binary vector \(\vec{b}_{k}\), which shares a logit-linear probability of occurrence:</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ \operatorname{logit}\left[P\left(\delta_{+}^{(k)} \mid w_{j}\right)\right]=\ln \left[\frac{P\left(\delta_{+}^{(k)} \mid w_{j}\right)}{1-P\left(\delta_{+}^{(k)} \mid w_{j}\right)}\right]=\ln \left[\frac{e^{\left\langle\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right), \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(\delta_{+}^{(k)}\right)\right\rangle_{B}}}{e^{\left\langle\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right), \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(\delta_{-}^{(k)}\right)\right\rangle_{B}}}\right] \\ =\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right)^{T} \boldsymbol{B} \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(\delta_{+}^{(k)}\right)-\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right)^{T} \boldsymbol{B} \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(\delta_{-}^{(k)}\right) \\ =\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right)^{T} \boldsymbol{B}\left(\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(\delta_{+}^{(k)}\right)-\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(\delta_{-}^{(k)}\right)\right)=\left(\lambda \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right)^{T} \boldsymbol{B}\right) \overrightarrow{b_{k}} } \label{eq:5.27} \end{equation}\] <p>where \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\), and \(\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right)^{T} \boldsymbol{B}\) is a coefficient item. Then the probability of the output is logitlinear in the language model subspace representation.</p> <p><strong>Limitations of Linearity</strong>. While the linearized representation allows LLMs to exploit linear relationships between linguistic concepts and uncover underlying semantic structures, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of the linearity hypothesis. Considering the complexity essence of language, to further explore these nonlinear aspects, we propose viewing the semantic space as a manifold \(\mathcal{W}\) equipped with a Riemannian metric \(\boldsymbol{g}\). We believe this perspective will open up new ideas for investigating the geometric properties of language.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The inner product of vectors, defined as \(\left\langle\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{i}\right), \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right)\right\rangle\), can represent the semantic similarity between two words \(w_{i}\) and \(w_{j}\).</p> </li> <li> <p>The outer product of vectors, given by \(\tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{i}\right) \otimes \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right)\), can capture the combination of the semantics of two words, which is a potential “meaning-blending” mechanism.</p> </li> <li> <p>Linear combinations of vectors, such as \(t \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{i}\right)+(1-t) \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{j}\right)\) where \(t \in[0,1]\), can represent the interpolation of word meanings or even “semantic gradients”.</p> </li> <li> <p>Linear transformations applied to vectors, denoted as \(\boldsymbol{A} \tilde{\mathcal{E}}\left(w_{i}\right)\) where \(\boldsymbol{A}\) is denotes the linear transformation matrix, can model the “semantic rotation” or “dimensionality projection”, potentially inspiring applications in sentiment analysis and related fields.</p> </li> <li> <p>Geodesics, which are the shortest paths between points on the manifold \(\mathcal{W}\), can be employed to explore the continuity and smoothness of language. These geodesics reflect the properties of a word’s local neighborhood on its tangent space, providing insights into the local structure of the semantic space.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In short, the framework of internal representation of information demonstrates the model’s capability to accurately comprehend complex semantic information. And the vector space modeling of linguistic concepts within LLMs underpins their ability to capture and process the semantic information present in human language.</p> <h2 id="53-integration-with-localized-knowledge-bases">5.3 Integration with Localized Knowledge Bases</h2> <p>The integration of localized knowledge bases with LLMs is formalized through the retrieval-augmented generation framework, and is crucial for enhancing their interpretability.

Experimental Results <chap6></chap6> </h1> <p>The process of constructing the domain-specific knowledge base has yielded substantial insights. In this section, we will explore the intriguing observations that emerged from this practice. These findings are presented as examples of how to merge RAG frameworks with open-source language models that are applied in real-world settings.</p> <h2 id="61-the-dynamics-of-transformers">6.1 The Dynamics of Transformers</h2> <p>Motivated by recent studies <d-cite key="Sander22,Vuckovic20,Geshkovski23"></d-cite>, we explore the dynamics of transformers on the space $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{E})$, where $\mathbb{E}=\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is elaborated in Section 5.1 . From this perspective, the process of predicting the next token in transformers can be likened to a <em>fluid dynamics</em> problem, where the <em>probability fluid</em> flows within the transformer architecture. Here, we use the terms “token” and “particle” interchangeably, reflecting their analogous roles in this model.</p> <p><strong>ResNet Dynamics</strong>. Among the class of neural networks, ResNets have become a prominent architecture since their introduction in <d-cite key="He2015"></d-cite>. ResNets are composed of a sequence of affine transformations, a component-wise nonlinearity, skip connections for \(k \in\{0, \ldots, l-1\}\) :</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ \left\{\begin{array}{l} \boldsymbol{x}_{(0)}=x \\ \boldsymbol{x}_{(k+1)}=\boldsymbol{x}_{(k)}+\sigma\left(w_{(k)} x_{(k)}+b_{(k)}\right) \end{array}\right. } \end{equation}\] <p>where \(\Theta=(w(\cdot), b(\cdot))\) are trainable parameters. We define the hidden layer number here $l$, and we can naturally interpret layer index as a time variable, for \(t \in(0, T)\) :</p> \[\begin{equation} \displaylines{ \left\{\begin{array}{l} \boldsymbol{x}(0)=x \\ \dot{\boldsymbol{x}}(t)=\sigma\left(w_{(k)} \boldsymbol{x}(t)+b_{(k)}\right) \end{array}\right. } \end{equation}\] <p><strong>Simplified Transformer Dynamics Model</strong>. Unlike ResNets, transformers operate on a sequence of vectors of length $n$, namely \(\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}(0)\right\}_{j=1}^{n} \in\left(\mathbb{R}^{d}\right)^{n}\), where each element of sequence \(\boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}(0) \in \mathbb{R}^{d}\) is a token and the entire sequence a prompt. Recall our mathematical derivation on LLMs in Section 5.1, we rewrite the self-attention matrix \(\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\) in self-attention \(\mathcal{A}\) as:</p> \[\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{A}_{i j}:=\operatorname{softmax}\left(\frac{\boldsymbol{Q} \boldsymbol{K}^{T}}{\sqrt{d}}\right)=\frac{e^{\beta\left\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{(i)}^{T}(t) \boldsymbol{W}_{Q(t)}, \boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}^{T}(t) \boldsymbol{W}_{K(t)}\right\rangle}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{\beta\left\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{(i)}^{T}(t) \boldsymbol{W}_{Q(t)}, \boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}^{T}(t) \boldsymbol{W}_{K(t)}\right\rangle}} \label{eq:6.3} \end{equation}\] <p>With the perspective of nonlinear coupling mechanism in the interacting particle system, the self-attention matrix \(\boldsymbol{A}_{i j} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) captures the attention given by particle $i$ to particle $j$ relatively to all particles \((i, j \in[0, n])\). Numerical observations <d-cite key="Vaswani17"></d-cite>, have shown that the probability vectors, rows of \(\boldsymbol{A}_{i j}\), in a trained self-attention matrix exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences in natural language processing tasks.</p> <p>As the result of Equation \eqref{eq:5.9}, layer normalization effectively constrains particles to a timevarying hyper-ellipsoid defined by the \(\sqrt{d}\) radius hyper-sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\). We can further assume the existence of a smooth isomorphism that projects the points on the hyper-sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\) to the unit sphere \(\tilde{\mathbb{S}}^{d-1}\). Under such setting, a transformer can be interpreted as a flow map on the space \(\left(\tilde{\mathbb{S}}^{d-1}\right)^{n}\), in which the input embedding vectors \(\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}(0)\right\}_{j=1}^{n} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}\) can be viewed as the initial condition. Then we have attention layer \(\mathcal{A}\) as follows:</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathcal{A}\left(\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}(0)\right\}_{j=1}^{n}\right)=\boldsymbol{A}_{i j} \boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}^{T}(t) \boldsymbol{W}_{V}=\frac{e^{\beta\left\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{(i)}^{T}(t) \boldsymbol{W}_{Q(t)}, \boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}^{T}(t) \boldsymbol{W}_{K(t)}\right\rangle} \boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}^{T}(t) \boldsymbol{W}_{V(t)}}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{\beta\left\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{(i)}^{T}(t) \boldsymbol{W}_{Q(t)}, \boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}^{T}(t) \boldsymbol{W}_{K(t)}\right\rangle}} \label{eq:6.4} \end{equation}\] <p>To illustrate our conclusions in a simplified scenario wherein the trainable parameters matrices \(\boldsymbol{W}_{Q(t)}, \boldsymbol{W}_{K(t)}, \boldsymbol{W}_{V(t)}\) are all equal to the identity unless stated otherwise, we can derive the single-head transformer dynamics (without MLP) as follows:</p> \[\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}(t)=\operatorname{proj}_{T_{x} \tilde{\mathbb{S}}}\left(\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{\beta\left\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{(i)}(t), \boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}(t)\right\rangle} \boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}(t)}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} e^{\beta\left\langle\boldsymbol{x}_{(i)}(t), \boldsymbol{x}_{(k)}(t)\right\rangle}}\right) \label{eq:6.5} \end{equation}\] <p>where \(\operatorname{proj}_{T_{x}} \tilde{\mathbb{S}}\) denotes the projection from unit sphere \(\tilde{\mathbb{S}}\) to its tangent space \(T_{x} \tilde{\mathbb{S}}\). Recall that we considering the output of a transformer as the probability measure, thus capturing the likelihood of the next token, one can view the transformer as the flow map between probability measure on \(\tilde{\mathbb{S}}\).In summary, the dynamics within transformer-based LLMs present a complex yet intriguing study of the flow between probability measures on the unit sphere.</p> <p>Inspired by previous mentioned theoretical frameworks, it is hypothesized that the final candidates for the next token can be viewed as a clustering of tokens within the “token space”, which can be interpreted as a small number of possible outcomes. To experimentally verify this, we model the dynamics of transformers under a less restrictive condition, simulating scenarios with different clustering phenomena.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/beta_time-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/beta_time-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/beta_time-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/beta_time.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Figure 6.1 </strong> Here we use <code>Axes3D</code> from <code>matplotlib</code> to visualize the position-updating process of the input tokens inside a transformer system, which is determined by attention weights (moderated by $\beta$ ) and the positions of other points.

Results indicate that adjusting $\beta$ controls the overall sensitivity and dynamic characteristics of the system. Faster clustering occurs at higher $\beta$ values, while slower clustering phenomena are observed at lower $\beta$ values. </div> <p>Originally, transformers update their internal states based on a sequence of operations involving layer normalization and softmax layers. By rescaling the vectors \(\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}(t)\right\}_{j=1}^{n}\) into a more simplified form \(\left\{\boldsymbol{x}_{(j)}(t)\right\}_{j=1}^{n}\), thus in accordance with the effect of the attention mechanism. The simplified model for transformer dynamics is then given by:</p> \[\begin{equation} \boldsymbol{z}_{(k)}(t)=e^{-t \boldsymbol{W}_{V} \boldsymbol{x}_{(k)}(t)} \end{equation}\] <p>thereby simplifying the analysis to a focus on the exponential interaction component controlled by \(\beta\), which modulates the sensitivity of the exponential function, enhancing or attenuating the influence based on the inner products of the state vectors.

With the help of LangChain-Chatchat, we can employ the RAG framework easily, which paves the way for the construction of question-answering digital avatars with localized knowledge bases. The retrieval component is generally a neural network trained to identify and fetch documents pertinent to the query at hand, while the generative component adapts this information into the response generated by the LLMs, thus significantly enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the model’s outputs.</p> <h2 id="63-hyperparameter-tuning">6.3 Hyperparameter Tuning</h2> <p>In our experiments, we also ventured into the realm of hyperparameter tuning, adjusting variables including but not limited to the size of chunking windows, model temperature settings, and knowledge match rate settings. We observed that as the language model’s values approached zero, its alignment and acceptance of its own identity as a large language model were heightened; conversely, as values approached one, the model exhibited lower levels of skepticism about its role as an “artificial intelligence assistant” and its impersonal nature.</p> <p>We found that maintaining the <em>temperature value</em> within a specific range ($0.2$ to $0.5$) and considering the context of historical dialogues influenced the <em>knowledge match score threshold</em> (related to the recall rate of data from the knowledge base). Our experiments commenced with a moderate threshold value of $0.5$, which we then adjusted based on the quality of the recalled data. For instance, if a threshold of $0.9$ yielded too little or no data, we would lower it to $0.1$ to determine whether more relevant data could be recalled. The knowledge match score threshold for LangChain-Chatchat showed optimal performance within the range of $0.6$ to $0.7$. These findings highlight the delicate balance required in setting hyperparameters to optimize both the precision and recall of relevant information, thereby enhancing the functionality and reliability of the language model in practical applications.</p> <p>The main hyperparameters of the ChatGLM3-6B model are outlined as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">max_length</code>: the total token limit for the model, encompassing both input and output tokens.</li> <li> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">temperature</code>: this parameter adjusts the probability distribution of words. A lower temperature results in more deterministic outputs, while a higher temperature yields less certainty.</li> <li> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">top_p</code>: a sampling strategy parameter of the model. At each step, the model samples randomly only from the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability exceeds a certain threshold $p$, disregarding other less probable words. This focuses on the core part of the probability distribution and ignores the tail.</li> </ul> <p>For tasks targeting specific character portrayals in the digital avatar project, we aim for the <em>intelligent agent</em> to appear more human-like, less rigid, and sensitive, capable of producing creative and diverse textual outputs in alignment with the predefined character script. Simultaneously, it should provide accurate feedback based on information retrieved from the knowledge base, as demonstrated by the results in Figure 6.2.</p> <p>Therefore, by fixing variables such as the content of the knowledge base, knowledge match score threshold, and historical input content, and by adjusting the temperature value, we experimentally determined an appropriate temperature range from $0.2$ to $0.4$ that avoids conflicts with the digital avatar’s identity and integrates seamlessly with the given identity in the prompt template. The experimental results are depicted below.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/ex1_p=0.35-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/ex1_p=0.35-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/ex1_p=0.35-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/ex1_p=0.35.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Figure 6.3</strong> ChatGLM3 discussing life and study in EIE, here $T=0.35$ </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/ex3_p=0.4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/ex3_p=0.4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/ex3_p=0.4-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/BT_LLM/results/ex3_p=0.4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> <strong>Figure 6.4</strong> ChatGLM3 discussing life and study in EIE, here $T=0.4$ </div> <p>When the temperature $T$ is set very low (approaching $0.1$), the output from the LLM becomes highly deterministic and conforms closely to “conventional” responses, showing a strong alignment with its predefined “persona”.

Effective prompts typically include task descriptions, background knowledge retrieved from databases, and specific user queries.

Conclusion <chap7></chap7> </h1> <p>With the rapid development of LLMs and their impressive emergent capabilities, there is a growing demand for new ideas and research to explore their potential in modeling <em>all</em> kinds of data. Throughout this thesis, we hope it can provide interested readers with insightful perspectives and analysis, empowering them with the necessary tools and knowledge to effectively navigate the prevailing challenges in the field.</p> <h2 id="71-limitations-and-discussion-">7.1 Limitations and Discussion <sec7.1></sec7.1> </h2> <p>Like many deep learning algorithms, the output from LLM suffers from a lack of interpretability. Research is needed to explore the mechanisms underlying the emerging capabilities of LLMs. It is particularly useful to understand how individual features influence outcomes. For example, in disease prediction, providing explanations for model predictions is crucial, which helps in understanding the impact of specific features on the diagnostic results, enhancing transparency and trust in AI-assisted medical decision-making.</p> <p>In the field of advanced NLP, the augmentation of LLMs with localized knowledge bases represents a significant stride towards personalized and context-aware computational systems. The primary motivation behind this integration is to overcome the inherent limitations of LLMs, such as the generation of plausible but inaccurate information, and the lack of domain-specific depth in generated content.</p> <p>During the process of prompt template designing, even if we both implicitly and explicitly specify to “do not add any fabricated content”, the unique information processing characteristics of language models often lead them to generate additional content. Despite strict prompt designs, models may still produce extraneous material as they attempt to provide complete or context-rich responses.</p> <p>Furthermore, the inherent behavior of these models and their training data can also lead to the generation of additional content while attempting to adhere to specific instructions. Various configurations and settings in the LangChain-Chatchat application, such as model selection, temperature settings, prompt templates, and verbosity modes, may also influence how well the model complies with prompt instructions. We prefer to believe that there are numerous factors under the RAG framework that can influence LLM outputs, making it challenging for this thesis to exhaustively address them all. This leaves a gap for future scholars and subsequent studies to fill.</p> <p>Additionally, we observed an intriguing phenomenon: when using an LLM deployed locally for knowledge base question answering, there is a chance that the first query may not receive an answer, and only after several attempts does a correct response emerge. This sporadic issue is challenging to replicate. Upon analysis and discussion, we speculate that this phenomenon is likely due to factors such as the initial loading of the ChatGLM3 model, document caching, and optimization of the reordering process.</p> <p>Moreover, switching to a localized knowledge base mode only mitigates the phenomenon of hallucination in LLMs to a certain extent, but does not eliminate it completely. For example, issues such as inaccurate results or the system generating fictional characters or fake news may still occur. We hypothesize that this is related to the quality and richness of the data within the knowledge base itself.</p> <h2 id="72-summary-of-key-points">7.2 Summary of Key Points</h2> <p>LLMs, a seeming more knowledgeable <em>artificial intelligent agent</em> other than humans, unlock the power of interactive smart assistants, which can generate plans or reason about tasks depending on the feedback from environments , and set up a great milestone in the field of NLP. In the early days, AI agents were rule-based and designed for narrow tasks, having limited capabilities, such as the chess machine <d-cite key="DeepB"></d-cite> . In contrast to this, LLMs can process, produce, and understand human-like text under all kinds of demands. To a relatively high level, LLMs have captured the complexity and nuance of human languages, ranging from daily languages, programming languages and to formal languages. Thus making LLMs possible to incorporate with diverse applications as LLMs-based agents, where LLMs behave as the brains, such as coding agents, conversational agents and embodied agents <d-cite key="PalM-E"></d-cite>.</p> <p>This thesis studies the methodological evolution and mechanistic interpretability of LLMs. We explore the diverse language modeling methodologies in Chapter 2 and analyze the inner dynamics inside language models in Chapter 5, specifically the transformer circuits and concept representations, shedding light on the nuances of text-generation progress and paving the path of the field in explainable AI.</p> <p>LLMs are capable of producing more accurate responses when assisted with the domain-specific knowledge base, which extracts and integrates contextual information from background information into the prompts. This process enhances the quality and relevance of the EIE-relevant data augmented into the LLM-based Q&amp;A system, thereby improving the output from user queries, as the results in Chapter 6 indicate.</p> <p>Furthermore, the study considered the ethical implications and the potential for misuse of such attacks in real-world scenarios in Chapter 6. Our findings emphasize the necessity for a proactive approach in the design and maintenance of LLM systems, ensuring that they not only perform efficiently but are also robust against evolving cybersecurity threats.</p> <p>In conclusion, our findings show that adjusting the temperature parameter $T$ significantly impacts the ChatGLM3 language model’s performance and behavior. Maintaining $T$ within the range of $0.2$ to $0.35$ provides the best balance for knowledge-based tasks, ensuring outputs that are both deterministic and flexible. Lower temperatures yield more focused and syntactically correct outputs, while higher temperatures enhance creativity and variability, which is ideal for tasks like creative writing and exploratory coding. For digital avatar projects, this range ensures consistency and alignment with predefined character identities.</p> <p>This thesis not only responds to the queries posed in Chapter 1 but also extends the boundaries of the current understanding of LLMs. By integrating theoretical frameworks with practical enhancements, it set the groundwork for future research aimed at unlocking the full potential of LLMs in diverse applications. The journey from black-box puzzles to transparent, efficient, and highly capable LLMs, marks a pivotal shift in the landscape of artificial intelligence, guiding future endeavors in the domain.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/2024-06-24-BT_LLM.bib"></d-bibliography> <div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 930px; margin: 0 auto;"> <script>let giscusTheme=determineComputedTheme(),giscusAttributes={src:"https://giscus.app/client.js","data-repo":"betagi/betagi.github.io","data-repo-id":"","data-category":"Comments","data-category-id":"","data-mapping":"title","data-strict":"1","data-reactions-enabled":"1","data-emit-metadata":"0","data-input-position":"bottom","data-theme":giscusTheme,"data-lang":"en",crossorigin:"anonymous",async:""},giscusScript=document.createElement("script");Object.entries(giscusAttributes).forEach(([t,e])=>giscusScript.setAttribute(t,e)),document.getElementById("giscus_thread").appendChild(giscusScript);</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://giscus.app/?ref_noscript" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comments powered by giscus.</a> </noscript> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Yiming Wang.
